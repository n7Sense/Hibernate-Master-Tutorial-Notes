Casecade
=============

If there is an Relation like One-To-Many
if we insert an Parent record and if we want to isert along with CHild record also the we have to use Cascade  strategies.

	1. Cascade : none 		only parent will save
	2. Cascade : save  		for insert record only
	3. Cascade : delete		for delete operation only
	4. Cascade : update		for update only
	5. Cascade : all		for every thing.
